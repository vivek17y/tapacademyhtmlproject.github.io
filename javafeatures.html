    <font size="10px">Features Of Java Explained</font>
</center>
<pre><font size="5px">The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to,
other things, its portability, security, and scalability. Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on
is one of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and 
several systems automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its 
built-in support formultithreading and security features. In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API,
making it simple to learn and use. 

Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the software
development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs
 and developers alike.
    
Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications.
There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the
development process while adding even more capability.</font>

<h2>Advantages of using Java</h2>
The use of Java as a programming language has a number of benefits. Some of the main benefits are as follows:
<ul><li>Java is a straightforward programming language since it is simple to learn and comprehend.</li>
<li>Java uses implicit pointers, making it a secure programming language.</li>
<li>Java code does not need to be constantly compiled in order to execute on a variety of systems.</li>
<li>Java has strong memory management, making it a robust programming language.</li>
</ul>
The above are some of the advantages of using Java and building applications making it the most
popular programming language after Python. 
<h2>Features of Java</h2>
A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below:
<ul>
    <li><u>Platform independence:</u> Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, 
        meaning that Java code can run without any changes on any platform that supports Java.</li>
    <li><u>Object-oriented language:</u> Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers 
        to create modular, reusable code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and 
        maintain complex programmes.</li>
    <li><u>Automatic memory management:</u> Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves
         developers of the need to manually handle memory allocation and deallocation.</li>
    <li><u>Security:</u> Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users
         from potential security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</li>
    <li>Rich API: The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide 
        range of practical tools for creating applications.</li>
    <li><u>Multi-threading support:</u> Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to 
        create concurrent applications that can handle running several threads at once.</li>
    <li><u>High performance:</u> Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code 
        execution while it is running.</li>
    <li><u>Scalability:</u> Java’s modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create 
        large-scale programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand.</li>
    <li><u>Simplified syntax:</u> Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler
         for developers to write and read code.</li>
</ul>
Because they enable writing, testing, and deploying software applications simpler, quicker, and more effectively, Java’s
 characteristics are crucial for software development. These capabilities enable developers to produce strong, safe, and
 high-performing programmes that satisfy the requirements of contemporary software development.
