            <h1>Why and How to learn Python Programming Language?</h1><font size="5px">
Python is the programming language behind giant applications like YouTube, 
Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more apps.

But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it
 to your knowledge stack?

Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant
 opportunities, amazing communities, and a successful and fulfilling software
 development career.

Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software development
 language developed in 1991, yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd 
 version of Python ( Python 3).

Let’s look at the reasons for the language’s popularity and how you can learn 
Python in the most engaging and practical way.    </font>

<h1>Why was Python developed?</h1><font size="5px">
Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and
tedious languages he was working with. Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project 
of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language. Fun!
The name suggests that already. But to understand what made Python one of the most 
loved programming languages continue reading below.
</font>
<h1>Features of Python Language</h1><font size="5px">
Here are the 5 major reasons that make the Python language so popular with a
fan base calling themselves “Pythonistas”.
</font>
<h2>1. Python is beginner-friendly.</h2>
<h2>2. Python is Easy to Learn</h2>
<h2>3. Python is highly versatile</h2>
<h2>4. Python is super flexible</h2>
<h2>5. Free and Open-Source</h2>


<h1>Applications of Python Language</h1><font size="5px"> 
    *Web development (Backend)
    *Software development
    *Data Analytics
    *Machine Learning
    *Artificial Intelligence
    *Mathematical Analysis
    *System Scripting and
    *Cyber Security</font>


    <h1>Why learn Python Language?</h1><font size="5px">
With an ever-growing community of Python users and its versatility and wide 
applications, it has become the most popular programming language (leaving
behind Java and C++). It has got abundant libraries, various frameworks, modules 
and file extensions.

Here are the top 3 reasons Python is a great place to start and take your coding
 to heights:</font>
<h2>1. High demand for Python programmers. <br>
2. Growing communities across the globe. <br>
3. Fastest growing programming language.
